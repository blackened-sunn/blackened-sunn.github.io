Welcome. I completed my PhD at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/philosophy.html) in spring 2025 and currently teach philosophy at [St. Joseph's University](https://directory.sju.edu/max-wade) in Philadelphia. 
I primarily work in the history of philosophy, with my primary area of specialization in ancient Greek and Roman metaphysics and natural philosophy. I also have done work on medieval philosophy and cosmology, and am generally interested in exploring pre-modern conceptions of nature, the heavenly bodies and their interactions with terrestrial life, and the artificial-natural divide. My [dissertation](https://www.academia.edu/129364017/Plotinus_Ontology_of_Artifacts) was on Plotinus' ontology of artifacts.
