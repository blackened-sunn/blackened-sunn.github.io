## Research

My academic research explores the development of natural philosophy from antiquity through its reception in the Middle Ages. In particular, I am interested in the way in which people historically understood the natural world, especially the relationship between broader cosmological commitments and their understanding of biology, physics, and technology. As such, my research works in the intersection of the [history and philosophy of science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_philosophy_of_science) and the broader [environmental humanities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_humanities). 
I am also interested in the history of metaphysics, especially the ontology of artifacts and some topics in social and political philosophy. 

I have ongoing research projects on Plotinus' metaphysics and theory of divination.
